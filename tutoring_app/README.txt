Tutoring App Project by Matt Zagame and Wilbert

This app aims to facilitate the tutoring process for college students by allowing them to readily schedule in-person meetings with verified tutors, based on the school they attend. Tutors can also register on the app to make the tutoring process easier.

Some students that may need tutoring may not be comfortable with getting the help they need. This app will give college students a more personalized tutoring experience, which should further encourage getting help from tutors, by allowing them to select the tutor and meeting time/place that is right for them.
