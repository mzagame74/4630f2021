1. Based on the reports in our last class, it seems that most people are looking
for an app that can improve upon either existing apps or provide a more
streamlined experience in a certain app category. For example, an app that can
find information on a product that you own more easily, such as the components
of a vehicle. Another example was for a productivity app that can log
individual team member's work in a way that is hassle free and convenient for
the entire team. My main takeaway from our discussion is that it is quite
difficult to come up with an entirely original app idea that has not already
been done in some way before. My idea so far has been to create an app that will
help people manage and save their money in a way that is simple and fun. In
addition, a payments platform could also be built on top of this. Of course
this type of financial tech already exists under a few different names, however
there is still room for innovation in my eyes. 

2. I believe the best way to handle this problem is to offer a free base version
of an app, and if a user wants access to advanced features or other perks, they
can support the developer by purchasing a premium service. If the app were to
involve a payments system, a small fee could be allocated out of each
transaction to go towards development instead. Either way, a large majority of
features in the app should be free with no obtrusive ads.

Mint is a user-friendly budgetting app that has a nice thematic look and simple
yet effective UI. Key information is presented foremost and menus are pretty
easy to navigate.

4. I would say that our discussion has shed some light on the type of app I
should be creating. For now, I am going to stick to the idea of creating an app
that in its most basic form shall inform the user as to how they are managing
their money, and then go from there.
